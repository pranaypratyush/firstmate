#   --mode and --yolo are this task's delivery contract, REQUIRED for every ship
#   spawn and refused on --scout and --secondmate spawns. Firstmate resolves both
#   per task at intake (AGENTS.md section 7); data/projects.md holds the captain's
#   standing posture as context, not as this task's answer, so a spawn never looks
#   the mode up. A ship spawn additionally reads the brief's recorded
#   "Delivery contract: mode=<mode>" line and REFUSES a mismatch, so the worker's
#   instructions and the recorded task delivery cannot drift apart; a brief
#   scaffolded before that line existed warns once and launches on the flag. When
#   the explicit mode carries less rigor than the project's standing posture, a
#   loud one-line deviation notice is printed and the spawn continues.
#   no-mistakes-prod-only is a registry policy rather than a task mode and is
#   refused as a flag value.
#   --harness <name> is the explicit per-spawn harness/profile adapter. The old
#   positional harness arg still works for back-compat.
#   --model <name> and --effort <low|medium|high|xhigh|max> are concrete profile
#   axes chosen by firstmate at intake. They are only threaded into harnesses whose
#   installed CLIs were verified to support that axis; unsupported axes are omitted
#   from that harness's launch rather than guessed.
#   Verified OMP launch templates carry the runtime bound configured by config/omp-max-time.
#   docs/configuration.md "OMP runtime bound" owns its default and accepted values.
#   --prewalk-into <model-spec> opts an OMP profile into native Prewalk and records
#   the effective target in task metadata. An unusable target falls back with
#   --no-prewalk when supported. Without that flag, fallback proceeds with no
#   Prewalk flags only when the launch home's effective prewalk.enabled is false;
#   true or unreadable settings refuse. Omitting this option adds no Prewalk flags
#   and preserves ordinary OMP-configured behavior. Every non-OMP harness refuses it.
#   Local OMP secondmate relaunches recover the recorded target when the caller does
#   not repeat the flag, so exact-session recovery keeps the same launch profile.
#   Remote secondmates refuse it because their control protocol does not carry a
#   Prewalk target.
#   --allow-project-omp-extensions bypasses omp's fail-closed check for tracked
#   project `.omp/extensions` code and `.omp/settings.json#extensions` roots.
#   Use it only after explicit captain approval:
#   omp auto-executes those files before the model reasons about the task, and
#   firstmate launches omp with --auto-approve. Firstmate's exact tracked primary,
#   fleet-hook, and supervision-branch extensions, including their imported OMP
#   helper closure, are allowlisted only for validated secondmate-home launches.
#   This flag has no effect on other harnesses. Successful OMP spawns record
#   allow_project_omp_extensions=1 in task metadata for auditability.
#   --backend <name> is the explicit runtime session-provider backend for this
#   exact task only (docs/configuration.md "Runtime backend" owns when that flag
#   is authorized). Without it, the script resolves FM_BACKEND, then
#   config/backend, then runtime auto-detection from the runtime firstmate's
#   environment: $TMUX, HERDR_ENV=1, or cmux runtime signals (via
#   bin/fm-backend.sh's fm_backend_detect, with cmux fallback details in
#   docs/cmux-backend.md),
#   then tmux.
#   Spawn-capable backends are the reference tmux adapter and experimental
#   herdr, zellij, orca, and cmux. Orca owns both the task worktree and
#   terminal, so ship/scout Orca spawns do not run treehouse get; cmux is a
#   session provider only, exactly like herdr/zellij, so it does. An
#   auto-detected herdr or cmux spawn prints a loud stderr notice;
#   auto-detected tmux stays silent; zellij and orca are never auto-detected.
#   codex-app is not a known backend yet; docs/codex-app-backend.md owns that
#   blocked backend contract. Default tmux spawns do not write backend= to meta;
#   absent backend= means tmux. cmux does not support --secondmate spawns yet.
#   A backend spawn refusal (missing dependency, version gate, unauthenticated
#   socket, or unsupported secondmate mode) is terminal for that selected backend;
#   callers must surface it instead of silently retrying another backend.
#   A herdr crewmate or scout is placed in the exact workspace of the firstmate
#   or secondmate process launching it, resolved from that process's own herdr
#   pane rather than from a workspace label (herdr enforces no label uniqueness,
#   so a label cannot tell two "firstmate" workspaces apart). A claimed parent
#   identity that is unreadable, contradictory, stale, or from another herdr
#   session stops the spawn before any worker endpoint exists. A launcher
#   outside herdr has no workspace to inherit and uses this home's own labeled
#   workspace, which must then match exactly one. --secondmate is the deliberate
#   exception: it stands up that secondmate home's own workspace.
#   Herdr additionally uses a default-on presentation-only layout unless the
#   local config/herdr-presentation-spaces file says off. A clean fresh task first
#   writes state/<id>.herdr-presentation atomically, then creates a disposable
#   workspace containing only the ordinary task pane. A successful clean create
#   upgrades its attempt journal with exact home, session, workspace, tab, pane,
#   parent, and label bindings. On a same-identity restart, that complete binding
#   plus authoritative metadata may replace one exact agent-free husk in place.
#   The journal, visible token, and labels alone are never endpoint or ownership
#   authority, and every ambiguous recovery stays on the flat fallback after
#   duplicate-agent risk is independently absent. Treehouse allocation and task
#   metadata are unchanged.
#   A clean projected create or exact resume makes one bounded attempt to hold
#   the one session-scoped presentation-order lock (keyed by named session plus
#   canonical socket, outside any home's state/) through launch handoff. Lock
#   contention warns and falls back to the ordinary flat layout before any
#   projection mutation. The exact response-derived new workspace is inserted
#   immediately after its owning parent (firstmate or 2ndmate-<id>) contiguous
#   child block. Ordering never authorizes lifecycle cleanup, and any
#   unavailable, ambiguous, or failed move warns while the spawn continues.
#   Every projected create, prune, and move captures and verifies the named
#   session's exact active workspace and tab. A detected focus change restores
#   only that exact tab id; an ambiguous pre-operation snapshot refuses the
#   focus-sensitive presentation mutation.
#   Every single-task invocation holds one task-id-scoped lock across backend
#   creation through metadata publication, so concurrent same-id spawns serialize
#   even when they select different backends.
#   With no harness arg, a crewmate/scout spawn resolves the CREW harness only when
#   config/crew-dispatch.json is absent. When that file exists, crewmate/scout
#   spawns require an explicit harness so firstmate cannot silently skip dispatch
#   profile consultation. A --secondmate spawn is exempt and resolves the SECONDMATE
#   harness (config/secondmate-harness -> config/crew-harness -> own), so the
#   secondmate-vs-crewmate split is DURABLE across every respawn (recovery,
#   /updatefirstmate, restart). A bare verified adapter name
#   (claude|codex|opencode|pi|pi-signed|omp|grok|kimi) overrides selection for
#   either kind. Hermes overrides only a crewmate or scout spawn and is refused for secondmates.
#   For crewmates and scouts, a non-flag string containing whitespace is treated
#   as a RAW launch command - the escape hatch for verifying new adapters.
#   Secondmates refuse every raw launch command and accept adapter identities only.
#   pi-signed launches that exact executable name from PATH and
#   refuses before endpoint creation when it is unavailable; it never falls back to pi.
#   omp resolves its exact executable and checks its required launch/recovery
#   capabilities before endpoint creation; it never falls back to pi or another harness.
#   config/secondmate-harness may also carry an optional model and effort as extra
#   whitespace-separated tokens ("<harness> [<model>] [<effort>]"). For a
#   --secondmate spawn, those tokens apply only when this spawn also resolves its
#   harness from config/secondmate-harness. An explicit per-spawn --harness,
#   or positional harness arg starts with clean model/effort defaults unless the
#   caller also passes explicit --model/--effort flags. When
#   the file governs the spawn, its model/effort tokens are re-resolved on every
#   respawn exactly like the harness axis, and explicit --model/--effort flags
#   still win over the file's tokens.
#   When config/secondmate-harness-fallback is present, the primary model's
#   provider quota is checked before launch and the fallback profile is selected
#   only for an unusable provider or effective headroom at the named zero floor.
#   Unresolved but usable quota stays primary, and launch failures are never
#   retried on the fallback; source/reason fields are recorded only for a
#   configured fallback decision.
#   A --secondmate spawn also propagates the primary's declared inherited local
#   material, so the secondmate's OWN crewmates inherit primary config and the
#   secondmate receives the primary's read-only shared captain-preference file
#   (fm-config-inherit-lib.sh). A successful launch clears pending inherited
#   config reread generations because the new agent reads the converged files.
#   --scout records kind=scout in the task's meta (report deliverable, scratch worktree;
#   see AGENTS.md task lifecycle); --secondmate records kind=secondmate and launches in a
#   provisioned firstmate home; the default is kind=ship.
#   Before a secondmate launch, the home is locally fast-forwarded to the primary
#   default-branch commit when safe; skipped syncs warn and launch unchanged.
#   Before a ship or scout starts in a pooled Treehouse worktree, that clean task
#   worktree fetches origin, resolves the current remote default branch, and fast-forwards to its tip.
#   An unreachable origin, unresolved default branch, dirty worktree, or
#   non-fast-forwardable base refuses the spawn rather than risking stale history.
#   An explicit --accepted-local-base <full commit SHA> is task-scoped to a
#   local-only ship and makes the pooled worktree use the current local default
#   branch without fetching or publishing it. Other delivery modes reject it.
#   The SHA must equal the project's current local default-branch tip.
#   Ship/scout spawns refuse to launch unless the resolved task path is a real
#   git worktree root distinct from the primary project checkout.
# Batch dispatch: pass one or more `id=repo` pairs instead of a single <id> <project>, e.g.
#     fm-spawn.sh fix-a-k3=projects/foo add-b-q7=projects/bar [--scout]
#   Each pair re-execs this script in single-task mode, so the single path stays the only
#   source of truth; shared --scout/--harness/--model/--effort/--prewalk-into/--backend/--mode/--yolo
#   applies to every pair. A ship batch therefore carries one delivery contract, and each
#   pair still checks it against its own brief; a batch spanning modes is two invocations.
#   If config/crew-dispatch.json exists, shared --harness is required for crewmate
#   and scout batches. The loop lives here, in bash, so callers never hand-write a
#   multi-task shell loop (the tool shell is zsh, which does not word-split unquoted
#   $vars and silently breaks ad-hoc `for ... in $pairs` loops).
#   Launch templates live in launch_template() below; placeholders replaced before launch:
#     __BRIEF__    absolute path to data/<task-id>/brief.md
#     __TURNEND__  absolute path to state/<task-id>.turn-ended (for harnesses whose
#                  turn-end signal rides the launch command, e.g. codex -c notify=[...])
#     __PIEXT__    absolute path to state/<task-id>.pi-ext.ts (pi turn-end extension,
#                  written by this script; outside the worktree to avoid pi's trust gate)
#     __OMPEXT__   absolute path to state/<task-id>.omp-ext.ts (OMP turn-start
#                  acknowledgement and turn-end extension, also outside the worktree)
#     __OMPSESSIONDIR__ task-local or secondmate-home OMP session directory for exact resume
#     __OMPRESUMEFLAG__ empty for a fresh OMP launch or the exact retained secondmate session file
#     __OMPPRIMARY__ absolute path to .omp/extensions/fm-primary-omp.ts in an OMP secondmate home
#     __OMPMAXTIME__ OMP-only `--max-time=<duration>` fragment from config/omp-max-time
#     __PITURNEND__ absolute path to .pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts in a pi secondmate home
#     __PIWATCH__   absolute path to .pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts in a pi secondmate home
#     __HERMESBIN__ absolute resolved Hermes executable (PATH first, then $HOME/.local/bin/hermes)
#     __OPINPUT__   absolute path to the canonical operational-input encoder
# Hermes TUI launches additionally inherit the task-unique lifecycle token as FM_HERMES_TASK_TOKEN.
# Verified per-harness turn-end hooks are installed automatically where enabled; some live outside the worktree.
# Kimi uses one surgically installed Firstmate region in $HOME/.kimi-code/config.toml,
# a firstmate-owned global hook and registry, and a gitignored per-task pointer.
# Hermes uses surgically installed entries in the active profile's config.yaml,
# a firstmate-owned global hook and registry, and a gitignored per-task pointer.
# grok uses a firstmate-owned global hook under ${GROK_HOME:-$HOME/.grok}/hooks
# plus a gitignored .fm-grok-turnend worktree pointer and a state token.
# On success prints: spawned <id> harness=<name> kind=<ship|scout|secondmate> [mode=<mode> yolo=<on|off>] window=<backend-target> worktree=<path>
# A ship task records the explicit mode/yolo it was passed; a secondmate spawn records
# mode=secondmate, yolo=off, home=, and projects=; a scout records neither, and both the
# success line and state/<id>.meta omit them.
# When the home session's frozen trace-context decision is enabled (see
# docs/configuration.md and bin/fm-trace-context-lib.sh), the meta also records
# one W3C traceparent= carrier, the same value injected into the pane as
# TRACEPARENT; the default-off path writes neither, leaving the generated meta
# and launch environment unchanged.
#   --traceparent <carrier> delivers a carrier that a REMOTE parent already
#   resolved and will record, instead of resolving one from this home's frozen
#   decision. It is accepted only for --secondmate spawns, only as a strictly
#   validated W3C traceparent, and exists because a remote secondmate's task
#   identity is owned by the parent home that holds its task metadata, while the
#   pane export happens on the remote host (bin/fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh).
#   Local spawns never pass it and resolve their own carrier exactly as before.
