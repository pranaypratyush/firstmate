# Evidence receipts and risk routing verification

This record captures the active maintainer evidence for ship-task acceptance receipts and conservative validation routing as of 2026-08-28.
The exact receipt key and type schema is owned by the header and `--help` output of `bin/fm-receipt-schema.sh`; the criterion parser, classifier thresholds, metadata fields, and lifecycle commands are owned by the headers and help output of `bin/fm-receipt-check.sh`, `bin/fm-receipt.sh`, and `bin/fm-receipt-store.sh` at their respective executable boundaries.

## Guarantees under test

- New ship briefs receive stable acceptance-criterion ids plus an empty append-only evidence ledger and lock through one atomic pinned-directory publication, while scout and secondmate scaffolds remain outside the receipt contract.
- Concurrent ship scaffolds use one exclusive brief identity, so a losing invocation cannot remove the winning brief or evidence contract.
- Ship scaffold output requires replacing both task and acceptance-criterion placeholders, and spawn refuses unresolved task text or criteria before endpoint creation.
- Legacy ship briefs without an acceptance-criteria section may still launch with an explicit migration warning, but the completion gate remains parked until Firstmate installs a valid evidence contract.
- Every ship completion, including a promoted scout, remains parked until a valid acceptance contract and structurally valid evidence cover every required criterion.
- Low-risk routing is limited to CHANGELOG formatting or reflow changes whose non-whitespace byte sequence is identical and which have file-bound mechanical proof, while every content-byte or uncertain change defaults high.
- High-risk, broad, sensitive, weakly proven, materially expanded, or uncertain changes retain full No-Mistakes validation.
- `direct-PR` and `local-only` retain the evidence gate and current-state reconciliation without entering No-Mistakes.
- The explicit implementation-complete action records one current timestamp for the current clean commit, refreshes that timestamp when the head changes, remains idempotent for the same head, and supplies the plan interval origin.
- Completion requires observed post-plan mechanical evidence, an exact No-Mistakes run that is distinct from the plan's recorded active-run snapshot, matches the plan's recorded branch and head, carries the latest unguessable plan generation, and when intent is redacted has both a ULID creation time strictly later than the recorded millisecond plan boundary and its exact immutable plan-bound creation attestation, plus current checks-green status or CI-log evidence, a GitHub PR with forge-observed exact-head metadata, a supported non-GitHub direct-PR with the existing canonical HTTPS PR URL predicate and no head observation, or a clean fast-forward-ready branch.
- Receipt append and check share one executable owner that resolves and pins every raw data-path component inside the store process, opens and verifies the task directory relative to that pinned parent, and then opens relative no-follow brief and single-link ledger paths portably on Linux and macOS.
- Receipt storage physicalizes the trusted Firstmate-home prefix for standard system symlinks, then retains no-follow checks for the data suffix, task directory, and task artifacts.
- Promotion pins and verifies its scout task directory before reading or replacing the brief and ledger, and refuses symlinked or out-of-root task paths before mutation.
- Promotion retries distinguish identity-bound unfinished rollback from committed retirement recovery, while post-commit reporting cannot reverse durable success.
- Planning retains the pinned shared ledger lock through metadata publication, so only receipts appended after the published plan boundary qualify as fresh mechanical evidence.
- The checker parent owns a read/write release descriptor before snapshot spawn, so early child failures cannot block cleanup waiting for a FIFO reader.
- Snapshot readiness status is checked and terminal on publication failure; hold documents ready `0`, refusal `1`, missing-ledger `3`, and pinned non-ship `4` statuses.
- Receipt append, check, and promotion consume one executable acceptance-criterion parser that requires nonblank descriptions.
- Structurally valid receipts require non-whitespace summary and result strings plus an explicit structured outcome; only `outcome=success` evidences a criterion, while failure, negative, zero, skipped, empty, placeholder, weak, and legacy outcomes remain unevidenced and `result` stays descriptive so expected observations such as `401` are unambiguous.
- Head-bound receipts store only the exact canonical 40- or 64-character lowercase hexadecimal commit id reported by Git.
- Receipt append holds a stable task lock, copies the canonical single-link ledger plus one complete record to a synced mode-0600 single-link temporary file, and atomically renames it over the canonical ledger so concurrent hard-link aliases retain the old inode.
- Criterion parsing rejects known scaffold placeholder tokens in balanced or unmatched brace forms while allowing concrete brace syntax such as JSON examples.
- One shared cleanliness predicate requires `git status` with submodule ignores disabled to succeed with empty tracked, staged, untracked, and submodule output for implementation completion, planning, binding, terminal completion, and final done acceptance.
- Every plan requires a resolved authoritative base and commit diff before it can publish any delivery path.
- Every diff input, including the special-mode summary probe, must execute successfully before risk classification.
- Normal and promoted ship briefs consume the same executable acceptance-evidence and per-mode delivery renderer.
- The pinned brief and task metadata must record the same concrete delivery mode before validation can proceed.
- Ship state requires exactly one valid recorded delivery mode before any No-Mistakes lookup.
- Findings that invalidate a receipt or acceptance claim atomically bind one generation-scoped idempotent finding-to-criterion marker to the invalidation-time head and receipt boundary, then require a strict non-empty descendant delta and a later successful receipt bound to the new head before replanning or completion.
- One pinned state-directory owner snapshots single-link no-follow metadata and performs compare-bound atomic replacements for every validation metadata update.
- PR registration publishes canonical PR identity and its validation publication generation through one compare-bound pinned metadata replacement after the watcher artifacts publish, and revokes those artifacts if that replacement fails.
- Successful exact branch-and-head runs can bind after reaching checks-passed or passed, while failed and cancelled runs remain ineligible.
- No-Mistakes status, intent, and CI-log observations use the shared bounded call boundary, with a supplied-agent intent marker accepted only alongside the plan's millisecond ULID boundary and exact creation attestation when the installed log surface omits the exact generation line.
- Every completion requires path-specific terminal evidence, records its plan path and validated head, invalidates stale completion metadata when the worktree head changes, and refuses completion until the change is replanned or revalidated.
- Local-only readiness and guarded landing consume one fail-closed executable default-branch resolver.
- Planning and completion refuse tracked, staged, or untracked worktree changes.
- Initial planning accepts a caller base only when it equals the repository's authoritative merge boundary, so a later ancestor cannot hide earlier task commits.
- Ordinary No-Mistakes findings return to the original worker through guarded custody return and then full revalidation.
- Direct-PR registration publishes its watcher before recording completion, while other paths preserve their earlier path-specific completion boundary.

## Known limitations

- Claim invalidation reads the worktree head immediately before acquiring the validation metadata lock, so an unsupported concurrent ref mutation can bind the marker to the earlier head; the single-operator workflow excludes that mutation during validation.
- PR registration snapshots and replaces metadata through separate pinned-store processes, so an unsupported concurrent byte-identical state-directory swap can move the transaction to the replacement directory; the single-operator workflow excludes state-directory replacement during validation.
